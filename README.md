# OpenGL-Hello-World
Repo for learning OpenGL/graphics programming introduction. Currently includes implementations of a dynamic WASD-bound first person camera, Phong lighting models & camera-oriented flashlight with attenuation, model loading using ASSIMP, outlining objects using the stencil buffer, and basic face culling. 
Following the https://learnopengl.com/book/learnopengl_book.pdf tutorial (with fun adjustments).
